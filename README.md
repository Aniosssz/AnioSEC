## Hosting

### Your Own Computer (Not Recommended)

If you want your bot to be active 24/7, using your own personal computer does not make sense because you will have to keep your computer on all the time and it will also slow down your computer's performance.
However, if you still want to host the bot on your own computer, just follow the steps above and keep CMD or Terminal open.

### VDS / Glitch

You can rent a VDS from a service provider like Hostinger, it costs money but most providers provide 99% 24/7 uptime.

You can import this project from Glitch and start your bot by doing the same steps in Glitch, you can access 24/7 uptime for free by registering your Glitch URL in a system like UptimeRobot. You can learn these topics more easily from YouTube.
